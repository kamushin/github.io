Title: MySQL 优化学习之路
Tags: MySQL
Summary: 阅读MySQL文档, 总结优化经验
### Overview

#### DB Level
- table structure: column data type | table with few or many columns
- right indexs
- storage engine
- data format: compression or not
- locking strategy
- caching size
#### Hardware Level
- Disk seeks 10ms
- Disk reading and writing. easier to optimize than disk seeks
- CPU cycles large tables compared to the amount of memory ???
- Memory bandwith when CPU needs more data to fit in CPU cache ???

### SQL
- use explain
- indexs
- avoid full table scan
- analyze table periodically
- read-only transactions 5.6.4+ // had read an article on ATA about this
- avoid transforming query hard to read, optimizer will do this

#### SELECT
- cover index: In some cases, MySQL can read rows from the index without even consulting the data file. If all columns used from the index are numeric, only the index tree is used to resolve the query. // need numeric ? TODO
- range index
    - MySQL does not support merging ranges， use union
    - `eq_range_index_dive_limit` To permit use of index dives for comparisons of up to N equality ranges, set `eq_range_index_dive_limit` to N + 1
- index extensions: add pk after each secondary index  5.6.9
- two kinds of filesort
- group by: loose index scan vs tight index scan, depends on distribution of column(cardinality).
